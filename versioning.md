# Versioning
Versioning should be provided in **hostname**, (hence the project name REST-x)
- It provides easier machine/container-mapping of different verisons.
- Current version could be mapped to standard api.example.com
- **Both versioning in URI or HEADER are discouraged**
- Version may be notated similar to electronics (2k7 ohm), with 2v2
